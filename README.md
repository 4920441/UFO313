# UFO313

I used my four UFO 313 for a couple of years, but now, even the Astra 28.2° East  shut down most of its Radio transmissions on QPSK Modulation (aka DVB-S)

Since Kathrein is not providing an update for these modules, I try to convert them to a internet-radio modulator, since the used technology is (as always) superb quality.

Other than the block diagram in the brochure I found the following after opening:

 - DAC5686 https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/dac5686.pdf?ts=1714152266028&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.ti.com%252Fproduct%252FDAC5686
 - MB86H01 https://www.fujitsu.com/jp/group/fsl/en/documents/about/resources/news/press-releases/2008/20081127e.pdf

(and many more)

It seems that the adio running out of the four MB86H01 is already I²C - so  cutting the connection to those decoder chips and feeding
own I²C generated by a ESP32, RaspberryWhatever  should be possible I hope.

So we could get a Internetradio to High Quality Cable Headend Conversion and use these superb devices for the next 20 years as well!
